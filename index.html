<h1>Film Performance in Relation to the Bechdel Test</h1>
<h2>By Haley Marconi</h2>
<p1>
    This project will take a closer look at how films released from 2000-2009 performed based on whether or not they have passed the Bechdel Test. 
    Using previously collected data, I will be observing 5 variables: the Bechdel Test cleaned variable, the binary pass/fail variable, 
    the international gross in release year variable, the IMDB rating variable on a 0 to 10 scale, and the number of IMDB votes received. The goal is to 
    analyze how passing movies compare to failing movies and shed light on the effects that prominent female roles have on a film's public reception.
